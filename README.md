# Serverless4J

A collection of serverless-related tools and libraries for Java - still in its infancy. For now there are

* A [Maven Plugin](maven-plugin/README.md) for making it easier to use the serverless framework with Java-supporting providers
* [Annotations](annotations/README.md) used by the Maven Plugin 
* A [Sample project](maven-plugin-samples/README.md) to show how to use the Maven Plugin
